# Document Review Implementation Context

## Project Overview
We are implementing a new Document Section Review component for a collaborative document editing system. This component will allow multiple users to review, edit, and provide feedback on documents with integrated AI assistance.

## Current State
- We have a comprehensive implementation plan documented in `Document Section Review NEW.md`
- We have example code showing the desired functionality and UI components
- The design follows a modern, clean interface as shown in the provided mockup

## Core Requirements

### 1. Document Review Interface
The interface must support:
- Section-by-section document review
- Real-time collaborative editing
- AI-powered content analysis
- Comment threading per section
- Document version control

### 2. Key Features to Implement
- Table of Contents with section navigation
- Section status management (Draft, AI Reviewed, Approved, Locked)
- Inline commenting system
- AI feedback integration
- Export capabilities
- Full document preview

### 3. Technical Stack
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- Framer Motion for animations

### 4. Implementation Goals
- Create a modular, maintainable component structure
- Ensure responsive design across devices
- Implement proper state management
- Maintain high performance with large documents
- Support dark mode
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Development Approach
We will follow a phased implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Structure**
   - Set up component scaffolding
   - Implement basic layout
   - Create section card components

2. **Phase 2: Core Functionality**
   - Add section editing
   - Implement commenting system
   - Add status management
   - Set up user switching

3. **Phase 3: AI Integration**
   - Add AI review functionality
   - Implement feedback display
   - Add analysis indicators

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Add export functionality
   - Implement full document view
   - Add collaboration features

## Key Considerations

### State Management
- Use React's useState for component state
- Consider Context API for global state
- Maintain efficient updates

### Performance
- Implement virtualization
- Optimize rendering
- Handle large documents efficiently

### Security
- Implement proper authentication
- Add role-based access
- Secure AI endpoints

### Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for AI features
- E2E testing for critical flows

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
2. Set up basic component structure
3. Implement core UI elements
4. Add state management
5. Integrate AI functionality

## Questions to Consider
1. How should we handle concurrent edits?
2. What's the best approach for AI analysis queueing?
3. How do we optimize for large documents?
4. What's the strategy for offline support?

## Success Criteria
- Smooth, responsive user experience
- Efficient document handling
- Reliable AI integration
- Proper error handling
- Accessible interface
- Cross-browser compatibility
